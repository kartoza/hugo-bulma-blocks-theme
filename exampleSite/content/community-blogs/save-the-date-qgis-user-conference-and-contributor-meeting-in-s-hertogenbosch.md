<p>We are happy to announce that our 25th Contributor Meeting will be held in &#8216;s-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands from 20 to 23 April 2023. </p>



<p>Leading up to the contributor meeting, we will also have a two-day International QGIS User Conference, on 18 &amp; 19 April.</p>



<p>QGIS Contributors Meetings are volunteer-driven events where contributors to the QGIS project from around the world get together in a common space &#8211; usually a university campus. During these events, contributors to the QGIS project take the opportunity to plan their work, hold face-to-face discussions and present new improvements to the QGIS project that they have been working on. Everybody attending the event donates their time to the project for the days of the event. As a project that is built primarily through online collaboration, these meetings provide a crucial ingredient to the future development of the QGIS project. The event is planned largely as an ‘unconference’ with minimal structured programme planning. We do this to allow attendees the freedom to meet dynamically with those they encounter at the event. Those sessions that are planned are advertised on the event web page and we try to enable remote participation through video conferencing software. Although our hosts are not funded and donate the working space to us, we show our appreciation by making one of our software release’s splash screens in honour of that host, which is a great way to gain exposure of your institution and country to the hundreds of thousands of users that make use of QGIS.</p>
