Quantarctica is a collection of Antarctic geographical datasets, such as
base maps, satellite imagery, glaciology and geophysics data from data
centres around the world, prepared for viewing in QGIS. The package is
developed by the Norwegian Polar Institute, as a tool for the research
community, for classrooms and for operational use in Antarctica --\--
freely available for non-commercial purposes.

## About the project

Quantarctica (QGIS + Antarctica) was first developed for in-house use at
the Norwegian Polar Institute, as a tool for our glaciologists. There
was a need for a low or no cost complete GIS with essential datasets
ready-to-use, easy-to-use, functionality rich and with offline
capabilities. QGIS seemed to be a perfect choice of GIS for the
collected datasets.

Quantarctica has been used to examine geographical data from continental
to local scales, for viewing scientific project data on top of base maps
or with other scientific datasets, and to prepare maps for publications
and proposals. Quantarctica has so far proven to be a great tool, and a
very good alternative and supplement to other software used by the
researchers. It has provided new opportunities for our researchers in
their daily work.

shelves thanks to the GPS tracking capabilities within
QGIS.](quantarctica2.jpg)

Since Quantarctica first came in use by our glaciologists three years
ago, there has been many requests in the research community outside the
institute to share this product, and we started to develop a public and
improved version to replace the in-house version. Following Antarctic
field testing, and adding new relevant datasets, Quantarctica version
1.0 was finally completed and made available for download in July 2013.

Quantarctica is to be all about community effort. With contributions we
aim to expand with data from other disciplines, such as oceanography,
atmospheric sciences, geology and biology, and hope and believe that
this tool can be useful for the Antarctic community as a complete
Antarctic GIS package.
