   interested in knowing about or supporting QGIS.

## QGIS.ORG Legal entities

1. The General Meeting (the Voting Members)
2. The Board
3. Two non-Board members who shall act as financial auditors

These three entities are in place to support and represent the broader QGIS Community.

## General Meeting

Voting members of the general meeting are the deciders of policy and any major decisions
that affect the general standing may be put to the Voting Members for a vote by the PSC.
Voting Members vote on any motion raised at the Annual General Meeting. Voting Members
also nominate and elect the PSC membership.

### Types of voting members

1. QGIS User group voting members
2. QGIS Community voting members
3. One OSGEO representative voting member
4. Honorary voting members

### Composition, appointment and role of voting members

The voting members shall be appointed according to the following scheme:

* QGIS User Group Voting Members: One voting member per QGIS country level
  user group. Each user group will nominate who their voting member shall be.
* QGIS Community Voting Members: For each user group voting member, there will
  be one voting community member elected.
* OSGeo Voting Member: One voting member representing the OSGeo foundation
  put forward by the OSGeo board.

### Election and eligibility of QGIS User Group voting members

* Only country-level user groups may put forward a nominated voting member.
* In order to be recognised, a user group must be approved by the PSC.

The user group should democratically nominate one person from within their ranks to act as
their representative within the QGIS.ORG voting membership.

### Election and eligibility of QGIS Community voting members

* QGIS community members will be nominated and voted for by the established QGIS
  committers.
* Any active QGIS community member will be eligible for nomination as a QGIS.ORG
  voting member.
* Voting Memberships shall be awarded on a ‘first past the post’ basis, with the
  nominee receiving the greatest number of votes being awarded voting membership
  first and so on in descending order of number of votes received until all voting
  memberships have been allocated.

### Honorable members

Honorable members are individual persons who receive special acknowledgment for
extraordinary achievements in the QGIS project. Applications for the nomination of an
honorable member should be directed to the PSC. The general meeting shall vote about the
acceptance of a new honorable member. Honorable members shall have voting rights.

### Voting member terms

Voting memberships will be valid until:

* The voting member resigns
* There is a motion raised from within the voting membership, and passed vote by the
  voting membership to remove the member
* A voting member gets elected to the PSC in which case voting membership of the
  new PSC member will be relinquished and a new voting member will be elected in
  the new PSC member’s place. Outgoing PSC members that were previously voting
  members will need to be re-elected into the voting membership should they wish to
  return to their former role.

### Sustaining Members

Sustaining members are members who support QGIS.ORG financially with an annual membership fee. This membership fee is used to cover expenses of QGIS.ORG infrastructure, events and other initiatives to improve the project. Membership fees help to ensure that the QGIS community and the software we produce can be maintained and improved in a sustainable way. Sustaining members have no voting rights (unless they are simultaneously voting members in which case their voting rights are unaffected).

The following categories are offered for sustaining members, based on their size and assigned through self declaration:

* Small (e.g. for smaller cities or companies up to 10 employees)
* Medium (e.g. for universities, medium size cities or companies up to 50 employees
* Large (e.g. for larger cities, provinces or companies up to 100 employees)
* Flagship (e.g. for companies larger than 100 employees, federal governmental organizations)

Membership fees are approved or changed by the general assembly. They are defined as minimum fees per category, but may be increased if the sustaining member chooses to do so.

Because QGIS.ORG is a world-wide project and different companies, NGOs or governmental organizations have different financial prospects, we do not enforce any membership levels - the organizations pick their own membership level based on self-assessment.

Acceptance of sustaining members shall be subject to the discretion and approval of The Board, who reserve the right to accept or reject applications for sustaining membership and ongoing support memberships as deemed appropriate.

The fees for membership levels and guidelines for management of sustaining members are provided in the governance section of the QGIS.ORG website.

## The board


The board is the legal representation of the QGIS.ORG project with authority to sign legal
documents on behalf of the QGIS.ORG project.

The official domicile of the association shall be determined by the board. The group is legally
represented by the chair’s signature and a signature of an additional member of the board.

The treasurer has sole authority to carry out financial transactions provided they are within
the bounds of the annual budget authorized by the general meeting.

### Election of board members


Board members shall also be members of the PSC and shall be nominated and elected by
the general meeting. In an election of board members, the nominee receiving the greatest
number of votes for each position (chair, vice chair, treasurer) shall be appointed. A tied
election shall trigger a re-vote until one nominee has the majority.

Votes of non-elected Chair candidates shall be used as replacement of the voter’s vice-chair
vote.

On expiration of a board member’s term, nominees from within the QGIS community shall
be put forward by the QGIS Voting Members. The outgoing board member shall
automatically receive a nomination unless he/she no longer wishes to serve on the board.

The board shall include at minimum these roles:

1. Chair
2. Vice-chair

Board and PSC members will receive no remuneration for their services other than
reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred when carrying out activities on behalf of
the board.

### Replacement of Board Members

In the event of a board member resigning from the board, the PSC shall put forward from within their
ranks a replacement for the board who shall serve in that position until the next AGM is called.

## The Project Steering Committee (PSC)


### Election of PSC members

On expiration of a PSC member’s term, nominees from within the QGIS Community shall be

automatically receive a nomination unless he/she no longer wishes to serve on the PSC. If
an incoming PSC member is a Voting Member, they will relinquish their voting membership
in the general meeting on joining the PSC.

Prior to the election, the outgoing PSC determines the total number of seats of the incoming
committee. QGIS Voting Members shall be allowed a number of votes equal to the number
of PSC memberships up for election and shall be asked to rank their votes in order of
preference. After removing elected Board members from the vote results, PSC memberships
shall be awarded on the total vote count, with the nominee receiving the greatest count
being awarded PSC membership first and so on in descending order of number of votes
received until all PSC memberships have been allocated. A list of currently serving PSC
