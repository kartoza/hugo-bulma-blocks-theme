# End to End Tests

## Testing Methodology
These tests are setup using the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/writing-tests) framework. They are intended to run on each commit to verify the site is working in expected order.

These tests exist to make sure code changes to this repository do not break how the site currently functions. 

On every commit, these tests will be run against the committed code. The tests will verify that the site is in proper working order with respect to the changes the committer has changed.

The reason for this is so that one can feel more confident that their changes will not cause issues to the site when it is deployed in production. The goal is to catch these issues well before they make it to production thus not causing headaches for anyone maintaining the site.


These tests are written in python using the `pytest` framework in conjunction with the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/writing-tests) framework.

Playwright is a framework which easily allows you to spin up a headless browser and write code to verify that specific elements and content on the page exist. 

For example, you can check that the logo on the header nav exists or that a page contains a subtitle with a specific text of, for example, "Hello World"

Each file in the `e2e` should contain a test related to a certain page. The file will test for elements on that specific page only (ie. the **Home** page, or the **About** page)

Each method in the test file will load the page it is planning to test .
```
page.goto("/")
```

And then once on that page, the test will grab elements on the page by querying the page with a selector. The selector is most commonly a css selector (or xpath) similar to what you would use with `document.querySelector`
```
first_card = page.locator('.card')
```
This creates a variable called `first card` which contains the `dom` element that has a classname (ie the '.' selector) of card `<div class='.card'>`

Once there is a variable with an element, you can make assertion against the content of that element as to what you expect to be in that element.
```
expect(first_contain).to_contain_text('Hello World')
```

This means we are verifying there is an element on the page that looks like this:
```
<div class='card'>Hello World </div>
```

If such an element does exist, the test will pass. Otherwise the test will fail.

You can checkout the [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/writing-tests) for more extensive testing methods.

## Getting Started


1. Run the hugo server

    `make dev`

2. Running E2E Tests (in a new terminal window)
    `make tests`

3. Add your own test to the e2e folder and get coding!
